Usage
-----

Take the example config (yukirc.json), modify it to your needs (remember to
remove the comments, which JSON doesn't actually support), then invoke
yuki.py with a path to your config. 

That's it, you can now query the bot for DPTs with '~dpt'.

Dependencies
------------

Requires [blackbox][], which is a `pip install blackbox` away.
